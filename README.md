# Question 3
You are given a sequence of non-negative integers terminated by -1. You have to output 1 if there are atleast 2 distinct elements in the sequence and 0 if the sequence consists of only 1 integer. Note that -1 is not part of the sequence. The sequence is not necessarily sorted. 

Note: Don't use arrays to this question.
